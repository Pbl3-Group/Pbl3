## üåü Project Overview

As a product of the Project-Based Learning 3 (PBL3) course, this project was developed to fill a significant gap in the labor market: a specialized, fast, and reliable platform for **part-time** and **temporary** jobs.

Our platform is designed to serve two primary user flows:

*   **For Job Seekers:** We cater to individuals seeking **part-time** work to balance their lifestyle or temporary jobs to **cover immediate expenses**‚Äîfrom students to experienced professionals.

*   **For Employers:** The platform meets the needs of two main groups:
    *   **Traditional businesses** looking for flexible staff for peak hours, events, or short-term projects.
    *   **Individual employers** seeking help with small-scale, temporary tasks.

To effectively connect these user groups, we have created a platform optimized for speed and convenience. A key feature is the ability for users to **flexibly switch between Job Seeker and Employer roles**, complemented by tools like **contextual messaging** and **automated notifications** to streamline the connection process efficiently.
